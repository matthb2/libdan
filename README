///////////// Description /////////////////

libdan is a library containing a collection of code for
High Performance Computing. The current components include:
    1. Structures: common CS data structures, most notably intrusive
                   linked lists and AA trees.
    2. Geometry: the beginnings of a 2D and 3D geometric kernel
    2. Messaging: wrappers around MPI, including an implementation
                  of the Bulk Synchronous Parallel model

///////////// Installation /////////////////

libdan uses CMake as its build system. So far our philosophy is
not to assume anything about the user's environment, so some
configuration is necessary. The compile process is as follows:

ccmake .
make install

libdan is written in C99 standard C, so most C compilers will
require the -std=c99 flag. libdan will emit a somewhat helpful
compile error if this is missing.
In addition, Messaging users will want to set
the compilers to their MPI wrappers.
We currently do not check whether the compiler is an MPI
wrapper.
